                <p class="text-muted text-left">The locality Greater Kailash falls in Jammu district situated in Jammu and Kashmir state, with a population 25617. The male and female populations are 13660 and 11957 respectively. The size of the area is about 6.67 square kilometer.Three-day annual holy Kailash yatra began on Saturday in Bhaderwah town of mountainous Doda district of Jammu division in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. AIR Jammu Correspondent reports that pilgrims from across the mountainous valley of Bhaderwah and adjoining areas, the Yatra has been organised with due observance of the Covid protection protocols. The Charri Mubarak of Holy Kailash Yatra left for Kailash Kund from the ancient Vasuki Nag Temple, Gatha in Bhaderwah. Amidst the chanting of religious slogans, the Yatra passed through the Bhaderwah township where the local administration besides President of Sanathan Dharm Sabha and a number of local people welcomed the pilgrims. After a night stay at Hayan (Nalthi), the Yatra will reach the holy Kailash Kund tomorrow where the devotees would take a dip in the sacred water of Kailash Dal. After performing religious rituals, the yatra will start its return journey to Bhaderwah on September 6, 2021. Worth to mention, the pilgrimage is considered as one
                    of the toughest as pilgrims have to trek 21 km steep Kailash Mountains Range in Doda district to reach 14,700 feet high Holy ‘Kund’ (lake), where devotees take a dip in the ice-cold water to take the blessings of the ‘Serpent God’. The administration has made elaborate security arrangements for the Yatra and Police and CRPF personnel have been deployed all along the route to provide foolproof security to the pilgrims. Besides, the Army has sensitized all the high-altitude reaches surrounding the yatra route.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
